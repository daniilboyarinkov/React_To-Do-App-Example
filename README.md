# To-do App example

That is my own realisation of To-do App example which I made from scratch as my first React project
So, please do not carp to my code.

> I'm juct learning...

In that project I used: 

+ React Class Components
+ Conditional Rendering
+ CSS Component Modules
+ LocalStorage Interactions
+ Drag & Drop Feature using react-beautiful-dnd

**You can see the web version of the project by following this link: **
